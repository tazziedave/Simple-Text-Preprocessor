This is simple file no4 to test the phpp preprocessor with multiple defines and nesting.
Results are:
	{12} => implies Def1 and Def2 have been tested, and are both defined
	{1}[2] => implies Def1 and Def2 have been tested, 1 is defined and 2 isn't
	[123] => implies all 4 have been tested and none defined etc.

Def1 is not mentioned, def2 is defined initially and def3 is undefined initially

	{1}
		{12}

	Defining 3, undefining 1 and 2

		{13}



		{1}[4]
		Defining def4

		{14}


	[1]
		[12]

			{3} [12]




Defining 2, undefining 1 and 3

	[1]

		{2} [1]

			{2}[13]
