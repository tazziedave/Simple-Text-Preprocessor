This is simple file no4 to test the phpp preprocessor with multiple defines and nesting.
Results are:
	{12} => implies Def1 and Def2 have been tested, and are both defined
	{1}[2] => implies Def1 and Def2 have been tested, 1 is defined and 2 isn't
	[123] => implies all 4 have been tested and none defined etc.

Def1 is not mentioned, def2 is defined initially and def3 is undefined initially

	[1]
		{2} [1]
		[13]
		[14]

Defining 1 and 3, undefining 2

	{1}
			{123}
		{12}

Defining 2, undefining 1 and 3

	[1]
			{2}[13]
		{2} [1]
